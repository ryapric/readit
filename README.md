RETIRED
=======

`readit` was initiallly designed as an all-in-one file format reader
abstraction. Very soon after its initial CRAN publish in 2018, I realized that
the [rio](https://github.com/leeper/rio) package already existed, and is far
superior. I have wasted a lot of time delaying the formal retirement of this
package, and now that is its status.

Please use `rio` instead for your file-reading abstractions -- I've even
contributed to it!
