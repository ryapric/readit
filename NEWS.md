# readit version 1.1.0

This version adds deprecation warnings via `.Deprecated()` to all calls to
`readit()`, pointing users instead to the `rio` package, due to its much better
design and enhanced functionality. The `readit` package is retired, and will not
be developed further.

# readit version 1.0.0

This is the first CRAN release of the readit package. Included is the readit()
function, which allows one-call data read-in for files of many different types
(flat/delimited, Excel, JSON, SAS, SPSS, etc.)
