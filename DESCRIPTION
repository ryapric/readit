Package: readit
Title: Effortlessly Read Any Rectangular Data
Description:
    Providing just one primary function, 'readit' uses a set of reasonable
    heuristics to apply the appropriate reader function to the given file path.
    As long as the data file has an extension, and the data is (or can be
    coerced to be) rectangular, readit() can probably read it.
